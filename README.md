# Online Food Ordering Website

This is an online food ordering website that allows users to browse a menu, view food items, and place an order for delivery. The site is designed with a clean and responsive layout, offering an intuitive user experience similar to popular food delivery platforms like Swiggy or Zomato.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**: Easy navigation with links to Home, Menu, Offers, and Contact.
- **Hero Section**: A visually appealing banner with a call-to-action button to encourage users to place an order.
- **Menu Items**: Display of popular food items like pizza, burgers, and pasta with images and descriptions.
- **Order Buttons**: Each food item has an "Order Now" button, ready to be linked to the actual ordering system (backend integration required).
- **Footer**: Contains copyright and contact information.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to work on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you only need a browser as the project is currently static HTML. If you want to extend this project with dynamic features or integrate it into a backend, you may need the following tools:

- Text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
- Web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Optionally, a backend (Node.js, Django, Flask, etc.) for dynamic functionality

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   If you have Git installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-ordering-website.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   cd food-ordering-website
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file** in your browser to view the website locally:

   Simply double-click the `index.html` file, and it will open in your default web browser.

## Structure of the Project

- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the website layout and content.
- **styles.css**: Contains styles and layout configuration for the website.
- **images**: Folder containing images used for the food items and hero section (you can replace the placeholder images with real ones).

## Future Enhancements

This is a basic static HTML website. Here are some potential features for further development:

1. **User Authentication**: Allow users to sign up, log in, and view order history.
2. **Menu Database**: Use a database to dynamically populate the menu items from a server.
3. **Shopping Cart**: Integrate a cart system where users can add items and place their order.
4. **Payment Gateway Integration**: Implement payment features for users to complete their purchases.
5. **Order Tracking**: Add order tracking functionality for users to track the status of their orders.
6. **Backend Integration**: Use a server-side language like Node.js or Python with a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) for handling orders and user data.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling and design, including responsive layout.
